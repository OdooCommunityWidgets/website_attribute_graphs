Odoo Website Attribute Graphs

Currently under development. This module is designed to create graphs that can be used on the website frontend for product attributes. Will allow display of charts and gauges using chart.js (https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js) and justgage (https://github.com/toorshia/justgage). This will be primarily for displaying product specifications.
